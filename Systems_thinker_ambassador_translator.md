## Whys ##
* Optimize my contribution to MTL
* Know my TeamPSD roles, responsibilities and tasks
* Higher ratio of productive output to time input  
* Understand other team members’ roles, our interdependencies, who to go to for what; efficiently onboard and incorporate new team members 
* Efficient method of communicating (notifications, questions) with TeamPSD members outside of meetings
* Straightforward and stable procedures for tracking and completing tasks
* Concise meeting purposes with agenda items identified as alignment-, consultation-, or decision-focused.

## Persona ##

*Age:* 60s married with adult children, eyeing transition to reduced professional work hours over the coming 1-4 years, located in Atlanta, Georgia

*Position:* Assistant project director, health policy; systems thinking/system dynamics SME; co-facilitator; program designer/developer

*Education:* BE, MPH

*Work Experience:* Decades encompassing engineering R&D; systemic social change to end oppressions; population health and health policy

*Team Experience:* 3 years

*Online locations:* iPhone, PC laptop (home), PC desktop (office), CAG-VPN 

*Internet usage:* 10 hours/day

*% Time on Team:* 20%

*Tech comfort level:* 7/10 (willing to learn when the amount of learning needed is finite and the payoff is obvious and substantial; having to learn too much tech can be disheartening when it impedes or obscures substantive contributions)

*Change comfort level:* 7/10 (adaptable and willing to change; frustrated when change is so constant that it hampers forward progress)

### What obstacles does she face?
* Being external to VA means learning curve re: VA org structure, technology systems, culture and terminology; also high level of administrative burden relative to percent effort (training, certification, documentation) 
* Multiplicity of platforms, procedures, jargon
* Uncertainty about expectations, concrete tasks, and how to accomplish them
* Competing demands of remaining FTE, particularly when cyclical high-pressure phases overlap

### How will she interact with platforms?
* Communicate across TeamPSD, with MTL co-facilitators, participants and other stakeholders
* Track meetings, tasks, deadlines, dependencies 
* Collaborate within and across workgroups; complete tasks; provide input to others
* Help develop, test, and disseminate

### What questions will she ask?
* Who needs what from me? When do they need it? What is the right platform and process for providing it? Who can answer my questions? Who needs to review and approve?
* How do I identify and address bottlenecks that I or others are causing?
* How can I help new TeamPSD members quickly and seamlessly join our processes? Which processes/how much tech/process do various partners need to join?
* What should I do if I find an error or have a question about a “settled” tool or product?
* How can I easily differentiate content that needs to be temporarily or permanently private versus that which can be in open platforms; and how can I easily know what content IS private vs publicly accessible on the platforms?

### Goals & Motivations:
* Workflow efficiency
* Focus of effort toward advancing MTL program and research
* Meaningful and valued contributions to MTL and, through it, to VA patients, frontline staff, system dynamics and implementation science fields
* Learning, teamwork, moving forward together

### Key Words:
* Efficiency
* Clarity
* Purpose
* Goal
* Progress

### Skills:
* Communicating system dynamics to broad audiences
* Designing interactive, peer learning experiences
* Writing, editing, designing, organizing, visualizing
