b. Understand clinic services available to veterans	

c. Document progress on SAIL measures	

d. Show VA clinic staff decisions that are not in their control	
		
**2. Which of these is a *Modeling to Learn* Module?**	

a. Psychotherapy (PSY)	

b. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)	

c. Clinic Data Management	

d. Mental Health Management	
		
**3. *Modeling to Learn* uses data that reflects:**	

a. A VA clinic team’s data	

b. VA data associated with SAIL measures	

c. VA general patient data	

d. VA primary care data	
		
**4. The data in mtl.how/data is presented:**	

a. Using means, medians and percentages	

b. By VA VISN trends	

c. In a format that allows a team to generate a team data table for use in the simulation model	

d. Only a and c 	
		
**5. In the context of *Modeling to Learn*, the acronym “UI” means:**	

a. User interface	

b. Upon interaction	

c. Under the influence	

d. Up in the air	
			
**6. When the learner generates a team data table for use in the model simulation user interface (UI):**	

a. Data is produced for each module in *Modeling to Learn* (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, Suicide Prevention)	

b. The data file will never have to be generated again.	

c. Any VA user can access the data.	

d. Only certain data items can be downloaded.		
		
**7. The Parameters tabs in the data UI, contain:**	

a. Data variables specific to each *MTL* module	

b. Patient-specific Data	

c. Clinician-specific Data	

d. All data from that VISN	
		
**8. New Patient Wait Time and Return to Clinic Visit Interval are examples of:**	

a. Variables that may be controlled by a clinic team	

b. *Modeling to Learn* modules	

c. Measures specific to only VA mental health clinics	

d. Terms used by VA patients when scheduling appointments	
				
**9. When reviewing the team data, it is most helpful for a clinic team to consider:**	

a. The trends in team care over time	

b. The units for the individual patient measures	

c. The differences between last year and this year	

d. The specific clinician diagnoses codes	
				
**10. By making team data available to clinicians as part of *Modeling to Learn*, it is hoped that:**	

a. Completion of EBPs templates may be enhanced	

b. Clinicians will feel in control of certain aspects of clinic processes	

c. Clinician coding for patient visits may be more specific	

d. Only a and b
