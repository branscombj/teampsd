Today we move from our very rich but only backward-looking data to the simulation tool that lets us take those team data and project forward how different choices within the team’s control might play out in terms of future trends in care delivery. You’ll log in to the simulation user-interface at MTL.how/SIM, see how to choose the team data parameters you want the model to use for this session, and check out for yourselves how those data you chose figure into this tool. By the end of today’s session, you should be able to

### 15–45	In-session exercise: Login and start a session

•	Open a new browser window and go to mtl.how/SIM. Enter your login credentials and hit enter, then pause there a minute. I’m going to make TeamLead a presenter so you can share your screen, in addition to everyone doing this in a separate window.

•	Is anyone not able to log in?

-	Once everyone’s logged in, ask TeamLead to share their screen so everyone sees what they see.

•	You may notice that if you’re not Team Lead, what you see when you log in is not exactly the same as what you’re seeing here in AdobeConnect on TeamLead’s screen. The Team Lead has a few extra things they can manage. You will have those when you’re in your Individual World. 

-	Explain Team world vs. Individual world. Also explain what it means for multiple users to be in the same world and how actions of User vs TeamLead affect each other.

OK, tell us what you see on this page, anyone, and let us know if it needs explanation.

-	Make sure the following are covered:
-	Team Name at top left
-	5 navigation icons: Home (where we are); Play; Chat; Help; and Logoff
-	Player Name at top right
-	Some welcome text
-	3 tiles with blue headers (2 collapsed by default): Session; Experiment Maintenance; Team Data Menu Maintenance.

We want TeamLead to start a session for everyone in the Team World. Since no one’s ever had a session in this Team World, you’ll want to Start a New Session. First you have to select which module you want to play in. Based on the Team’s needs from last time, we determined the best place for you to start would be in the XXX module. So select that. 

This brings up an option to select the team data you want to use, so check that.

Now you see all of the team data parameter files you’ve uploaded. Which do you want to use? Select that. Then click Play.

Now you’re in the main page of the SimUI.

Everyone else, if you go back to the browser window where you’re logged in to the Sim, you can select “Join Current Session” and click Play, and you’ll be seeing what TeamLead is showing.

On this screen, at the top you still see your Team Name, the 5 navigation icons, and your username on the right.

And there are 3 tiles with dark blue headers: The large one on the left with the system diagram has the name of the module in the header at left, and the Team Data file you selected at the right.

On the right of the screen, the top tile is called Output and the bottom one is called Experiments. We’re going to get into the model diagram and Output tile later; right now we want to click to expand the Experiments tile and let you get familiar with the Team Data Table, which is populated by the parameters file you chose on the homepage. 

Throughout the SimUI, you’ll see information icons (“i”). Could TeamLead click to open the information about the Team Data Table and read the description for us.

Now everyone please take a minute to review the table and then we’ll discuss it. Give ~30-45 seconds.

MTL is designed to empower frontline staff to improve decisions at your level of control. These are some of the variables that we’ve learned over the past couple of years from frontline staff that they do influence – whether deliberately or not. What types of decisions does your team make related to Appointment Supply? 

How about Return-to-clinic Visit Interval (RVI).

How do the values in this table strike you – do they line up with how you think things really are? If things have changed a lot in the past 6 months, they might feel a little off because as TeamLead read, these are based on a year’s worth of the team’s data from 6 to 18 months ago. 

DO team b) exercise where they look for a team data variable in the diagram and a) read the "i" test in the team data table, and b) look in the diagram to see what's it's related to
