[ ] Signifies explanatory notes and instructions for the facilitator; i.e. things they do not say out loud during session. This content stays in final Manual. How it will be designated/formatted is tbd; GHPC recommendation is that it be in RED font vs. black for script.

## Running a Base Case scenario in the Aggregate Module

TeamLead: Login to your Team World and Start a New Session, selecting Aggregate and the Team Data file you would like to use. Click Play.

TeamMembers: Login to your Team World and Join Current Session. Click Play.

Confirm/orient yourself to the main page: TeamName in the top left; selected module and data file in the tile header below; a new system diagram in the main tile.

Open the Experiments tile and review the settings: All sliders at Base Case (BC); Engagement Pattern in the default mode: Service Proportions from Team Data; Sensitivities at 1.

Open the Output tile and click Expand.

A Base Case Scenario is one that projects likely future outcomes if nothing were to change from where the model starts out with your team data parameters. This is unrealistic in the real world; but in the sim world, it is very valuable in providing someting against which to compare possible decisions you could make, one by one.

Enter text in the boxes Our Question and Our Hypothesis to reflect your interest in establishing a base case run and what you think the output charts will look like when you run it. 

Now click Run. After the simulation finishes running, before you do anything else it’s a good idea to save it. Click Save.

You will see a pop-up window reminding you that to get full value out of a simulation, you really need to think through the whole experiment and record your thoughts in all four boxes. You can go ahead and say Yes to save even though you’re not finished filling in the 4 boxes.

Choose Base Case in the top Variable drop-down menu and click Add. That’s an adequate name for this run. Later, you will add variables that were adjusted for experimental runs. 

Now, since we haven’t seen the Results yet, or considered them to make further Decisions (to complete the other 2 text boxes), do NOT click Save and Reset – just click  Save at the top.

Scroll down to the Results Dashboard and review the charts. Orient yourself to the charts – x and y axes, “Today” marker, units in top left, legend at left allowing comparison of 2 alternatives, shown in red and blue, to the current run shown in black.

In the Agg module, you have another choice: to compare results across services for a specific run instead of comparing outcomes for a specific service across different experiments.

Since we’re not comparing experiments but just want to look at the results of this base case run, go to the Control Panel on the left and select Compare Services.

What do you notice about the results? Do they match your hypothesis? Compare the values you see in the charts with the Team Data Table numbers.

Record your Findings in the text box.

Decide what you want to look into next. Record your decisions in the text box. Save and Reset when ready.
