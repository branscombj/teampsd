# MTL Facilitate Pilot

## Session 6 Mutual Learning Activity - Telling the CC System Story

  + Tools: *MTL.how/sim*  
  + Resources: Flip charts, markers, sticky notes, tape
  + Preparation: Pre-draw basic Appointments and Patients structure on flip chart pages.
  + Format: *MTL Facilitate Learners* will work in two groups.

 # Learning Objectives  
 + Understand complex relationships between appointments and patients in the CC model.  
 + Tell the CC systems story.  
 + Develop a team question that will lead to an experiment in the CC model.  

## Purpose  
This exercise is about making sense of complexity. This is a process of discovery and thinking about complexity in an orderly way that allows you to tell the CC systems story so that you can help others understand the complexity of managing patients and appointments in the VA health system. It will also encourage development of a question for running an experiment in the CC model.  

### Activity  

* Two *MTL Facilitate Learners* will volunteer to lead the activity.  
* The co-facilitators will lead a "popcorn activity." They will point out the two categories in the main tile of the CC model: Appointments and Patients.  
* Each *MTL Facilitate Learner* will have the opportunity to tell the CC systems story by "popping up" to the screen at the front of the room and walking the group through one section of the main model tile.  
* Facilitators will ask learners to "reveal complexity" as we move through the activity.  
* Reminder: When two variables are connected by a arrow, the plus signs means the variables are moving in the "same direction" and the minus signs means movement in the "opposite direction."  
* Starting with the Appointments section of the CC model, the facilitators will call on individuals learners to come up and explain how at least two variables are connected through a small section of the model.  
   ++ Appointments: Booking Rate, Appointments in CC, Completing Rate  
   ++ Appointments: Reveal "Overbooking Affects No-Shows"  
   ++ Appointments: True Missed Appointment Rate, Appointments to Reschedule and Rescheduling Rate  
* Scroll down to see the Patients section of the CC model:  
   ++ Patients: Starting Rate, Patients in CC, Ending Rate  
   ++ Patients: Reveal "Wait Time Affects Referrals"  
   ++ Patients: Target Wait Time and Referral Rate  
   ++ Patients: Balancing Loop  
* Reveal Complexity: "Balancing Patients" and walk through connections between Appointments and Patients.  
   ++ Balancing Loop: Balancing Existing and New Patients  
* TeamPSD lead facilitators will walk the *MTL Facilitate Learners* through the process of drafting text for *Our Question* in which the team will *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.*  
* One *MTL Facilitate Learner* will enter the question into the box Outputs tile. 
* Debrief the experience and walk through the CC systems story a final time.
