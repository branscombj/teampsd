## Session 7. In-session exercise: Running a Base Case

1.	Login to your world and start a new run in the Aggregate module, with the team data file you’d like to use.

2.	Orient yourself to the main page: Team Name; selected module; selected data file; a new system diagram, with multiple Services available to select in the Experiment Timeline box; all settings in the Experiments tile at Base Case or default values.

3.	Open the Expanded Outputs tile and enter text in the boxes to reflect your question and hypothesis about a base case run – one where no changes are made and you run the simulation out to its 2-year end just using the data pulled in from your team data file. 

4.	Run; then Save (without resetting) the run with the name Base Case.

5.	Review the Current Run Experiment Values in the Control Panel: shows Base Case or default values.

6.	Orient yourself to the charts in the Results Dashboard (axes, units, legend, drop-down menu options).

7.	Switch the output view from the default, Compare Experiments, to Compare Services in the Control Panel. 

8.	What do you notice about the results? Do they match your hypothesis? Compare the values you see in the charts with the Team Data Table numbers.

9.	Record your Findings in the text box.

10.	Decide what you want to look into next. Record your decisions in the text box. Save and Reset when ready.
