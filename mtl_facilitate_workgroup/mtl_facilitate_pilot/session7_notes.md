# MTL Facilitate Pilot Facilitator Debriefing Notes from Session 7

## Questions about service proportions and appointment supply...


**QUESTION:**
What is likely to happen in our team over the next two years if we make no new decisions?

**HYPOTHESIS:**
We think that our referral rates are mismatched to our appointment supply, even if we change nothing, because of the feedback (us adjusting our referral rates) our team system will find a steady state.

**FINDINGS:**
When we make no new decisions,  
-with our current supply of appointments and patient demand for psychotherapy, 
-with the balancing feedback our patients waiting to start increases really fast, and 
-then comes back to a steady state with patients waiting to start for psychotherapy.
-Intake is the first that happens, then they're in the team, then we try to find the right treatment at the right time, 
-but the intake doesn't happen again. 
-So, the intake is upstream of the other services, so the we're doing it to ourselves.

**DECISIONS:**
If we're doing this to ourselves, then it means we could make different that would supply and demand in better balance at the team level.
- Appointment supply (how should we allocated our grids to the services) and service proportions
- What would happen if we started to bring our psychotherapy patients back more frequently (RVI) an shorten the median engagement.
- We think 25% of patients can get psychotherapy 
- We are getting a lot of pressure on intakes - What can we do with our intake rate?
