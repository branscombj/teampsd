My name is Elizabeth Bowling, I am a project manager with Veterans Affairs, Employee Education System. I work as a project manager, healthcare education specialists within our Broadcast and Video division. In my role as a PM, I manage resources, timelines and support the development of education and trainings in a variety of mediums. For Modeling to Learn, I support the accreditation for the live webinars and videos. In addition to supporting the accreditation, I supported the funding for production of the 19 hours of video in our Employee Education System studios.  It is my pleasure to work with the MTL team, the MTL project is complex and large, but the mission is one I believe is worth investing in as MTL will improve the care to our Veterans.
