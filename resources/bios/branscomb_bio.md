Jane Branscomb is a senior research associate at the Georgia Health Policy Center at Georgia State University and a co-facilitator of *Modeling to Learn*. She joined Team PSD to help in designing the simulation user interface and facilitation plan for *MTL*. The skills and passions that fueled Jane’s work in engineering, health policy, and social justice advocacy come together in her role. At GHPC, she trains colleagues and clients in systems thinking and uses principles of participatory system dynamics, data visualization, and adult learning to facilitate groups tackling complicated challenges – whether civic leaders aiming to transform the health of a region or providers dedicated to veterans’ mental health. Offline she savors Georgia’s mountains, swamp, and barrier islands, or contentedly walks and weeds in Atlanta.
