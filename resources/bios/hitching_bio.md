Rita Hitching is joining the PSD team at the start of September 2019.  She
has worked in research for 20+ years with a focus on mood disorders, anxiety, and PTSD - most recently at the VA Palo Alto and Stanford School of Medicine.  She moved to the US 8 years ago from Australia, where
she worked as part of a team diagnosing and evaluating the management of patients with refractory mood disorders. 
She has worked in a range of research studies including the international Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve
Depression (STAR*D), using TMS to probe neural circuits and mapping the results using EEG and fMRI to understand the
neural basis for psychopathology, PTSD and depression.  In addition to working with the PSD team, she is concurrently contributing and project managing a second book on how to address the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms in older adults with  major neurocognitive
disorder. In her free time, she blogs on teenage brain development and syndicates content to a few magazines and newspapers (teenbrain.info). Her hobbies
