Andrew Holbrook is the data guy. He rides out onto the prairie of the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, where terabytes of wild data roam in vast, thundering herds. He selects the best thoroughbred datapoints from the herds where TeamPSD needs can be met. Andrew groups and orders them by the millions so they can be hitched to the TeamPSD wagon in an elaborate harness of his own design.
