Stacey Park is part of the “headquarters” team on TeamPSD as the platform manager. She coordinates projects, timelines, workgroups, and workflows across the nationally distributed team and facilitates stakeholder engagement from frontline staff to national leaders. Stacey manages a plethora of platforms the team uses to communicate and share information in an open-science, reproducible, and public manner, using R and R Markdown packages.  She received her undergraduate degree in Psychology from Princeton University with interests in healthcare access and health equity. When she is not maintaining the balance on TeamPSD, she can be found enjoying the CA sunshine and exploring the Latin dance scene.
