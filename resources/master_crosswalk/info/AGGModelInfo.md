| Actual Return Visit Interval                                        | The actual average return to clinic interval the team maintains.  This is either the same as the RVI used when appointments are scheduled, or potentially longer, if the team reacts to work pressure by increasing extending existing patients' RVI.  Appointments are never cancelled due to high wait times, but actual RVI is capped at 12 months (52 weeks) for ease of display.

(appts)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Appropriate Patient Start Rate for Supply                           | The number of patients who start in each service each week is either, 1) based on how much of the team's total supply remains after all existing patients are seen (plus any additional appointments set asside for new patients), or 2) the team's historical new patient start rate, regardless of supply.  (pts/wk)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Booking Rate                                                        | The booking rate combines demand from both existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) and new patients' first appointments.

| Completing Rate                                                     | Appointment completions in each service are based on the team either satisfing all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or using all the supply allocated to that service (based on the Appointment Supply).  If there is more demand than supply, then not all scheduled appointments will be seen in a timely manner, and Actual RVI will increase.  This is different from a completed visit, as the appointment is still complete even if the patient no-shows.

| Delay to Starting Service                                           | The average wait time for the team's patients to start in a service after either an intake appointment or review.  It is calculated from the number of patients waiting and the rate at which they start each service.   Wait time is capped at 52 weeks (wks)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Effect of  Long-Term Overtime on Burnout                            | When the team uses overtime, one of the long-term costs is burnout. Persistently working long workweeks relative to normal eventually increases provider quit rate, and thus reduces actual team hours available. The more persistent overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more the quit rate will increase, compared to the norm.  This effect only applies to overtime: persistently working lower than the official work hours does not create new staff hours or attract other staff to work on this team. (pct)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Effect of Short-Term Overtime on Missed Appointments                | When the team uses overtime, one of the short-term costs is that they have less time available for important, but non-patient-facing care tasks  (e.g., appointment prep, charting, follow-up, reminder calls).  The more overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more the missed appointment rate will increase, compared to the norm.  This effect only applies to overtime: working lower than the official work hours does not influence providers or patients to come more regularly to their appointments. (pct)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Effect of Wait Times on Intake Evaluation Rate                      | When the wait time to start a service increases above the target wait time, referring providers will be less likely to refer a new patient to that service.  This effect only applies to above-target wait times:  lower than expected new patient wait times do not increase referrals above the norm.  (pct)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Effect of Work Pressure on Overtime                                 | When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure."  One response to increasing work pressure is for the team to work overtime.  The more work pressure a team experiences for a specific service, the greater this effect, and the more the overtime the team will work in that specific service.  This effect only applies to increasing work pressure: having fewer appointments on the calendar that the team can see in a timely way does not influence providers to work fewer hours. (pct)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Effect of Work Pressure on Scheduled Return Visit Interval          | When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure."  One response to increasing work pressure is for the team to see their patients less often.  The more work pressure a team experiences for a specific service, the greater this effect, and the longer the scheduled return to clinic interval (RVI) for that specific service.  This effect only applies to increasing work pressure: having fewer appointments on the calendar that the team can see in a timely way does not influence providers to see patients more often. (pct)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Effect of Provider Fatigue on Patient's Engagement Time             | When the team uses overtime, one of the long-term costs is fatigue and lower patient satisfaction. Persistently working long workweeks relative to normal eventually reduces patients' satisfaction and thus reduces the average time patients are engaged in care. The more persistent overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more the engagement time will decrease, compared to the norm.  This effect only applies to overtime: persistently working lower than the official work hours does not increase patient satisfaction and engagement time. (pct)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Effect of RVI Delays on Treatment Decisions                         | When care delays increase (as measured by the return to clinic visit intervals (RVI) for a service increasing above the scheduled RVI), the team will be less likely to decide that patient should start that service.  This effect only applies to actual RVIs rising above scheduled RVIs:  lower than scheduled RVIs do not increase provider decisions to start patients.

| Effect of Start Delays on Treatment Decisions                       | When the wait time to start a service increases above the target wait time, the team will be less likely to decide that patient should start that service.  This effect only applies to above-target wait times:  lower than expected wait times do not increase provider decisions to start patients.

It is measured by the ratio of the hours needed for each service (based on the appointments on the calendar and the return to clinic interval) against the actual hours available for each service.  When the team works the same hours as their patients need (so each patient can be seen at the appropriate return to clinic interval), then the ratio is 1.  If a team has more appointments than they can see given the RVI, then work pressure will rise above 1.

| Return Visit Interval (RVI)                                         | The scheduled average return to clinic visit interval for each service, regardless of whether or not the team has enough supply for the patient demand or the effect on new patient starts. This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data.  (wks)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Sensitivity of Staff Burnout Due to Long-Term Overtime              | This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime has on team burnout and quits.  A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overtime and burnout and quits.  A value of "1" implies the assumption that doubling the hours worked over the official hours will eventually cause enough quits to cut the official hours offered in half.  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would eventually reduce the official team hours to 71% of its original value, and a value of 1.5 would reduce the official hours to 35% of the original.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Sensitivity of Staff Missed Appointments Due to Short-Term Overtime | This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime have on time for non-patient-facing care tasks and missed appointments.  A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overtime and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that providers are not sensitive to small changes in overtime and non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that providers are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than their official supply, then an value of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20% increase in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5% increase in the missed appointment percentage).  A value of "2" would cause that same 20% increase to have a greater effect ( raising the missed appointment percentage by 44%). |
| Sensitivity of Intake Evaluation Rate to Wait Times                 | This controls the magnitude of the effect increases in wait time have on the inflow of patients for intake evaluations, where these drop as wait time increases.  A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between wait time and the demand for intake evaluations.  A value of "1" indicates that if  the wait time doubles, then the demand for intake evaulations will be cut in half.  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would result in less of an effect (reducing the demand for intake evaluations to 71% of its original value), and a value of "1.5" would result in a greater effect (reducing the demand for intake evaluations to less than 35% of its original value).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Sensitivity of Overtime to Work Pressure                            | This controls the magnitude of the effect work pressure has on overtime, where an increase in appointment backlog causes the team to work more "unofficial" hours to increase the completion rate to mitigate that increase. A value of "zero" implies that the team will not use overtime or overbook appointments for any amount of work pressure.  A value of "1" implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and the amount of overtime used (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double the hours worked per week).  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would only increase the hours worked to 41% over the original value, and a value of 1.5 would increase the hours worked to 182% over the original value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Sensitivity of Scheduled Return Visit Interval to Work Pressure     | This controls the magnitude of the effect of work pressure has on the return to clinic interval (RVI), where an increase in appointment backlog causes the team to extend the scheduled RVI for current patients. A value of "zero" implies that the team will not delay existing patients' care (i.e., extend patients' RVI) for any amount of work pressure. A value of "1" implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and RVI (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double the RVI).  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would only increase the RVI by 41% over its original value, and a value of 1.5 would increase the RVI by 182% over the original value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Sensitivity of Patient's Engagement Time to Provider Fatigue        | This controls the magnitude of the effect  provider fatigue has on patients' duration in each service, where the total time in a service drops as fatigue increases.  A value of "zero" implies that provider fatigue will have no effect on patient satisfaction. A value of "1" implies the assumption that doubling provider fatigue (e.g., short-term increases in work hours) will reduce the patients percieved quality of service, and thus patients' willingness to remain in that service by half.  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would reduce the average duration in that service to 71% of the original time in service, and a value of 1.5 would reduce the duration to only 35% of the original duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Sensitivity of Treatment Decisions to Existing Patient Care Delays  | This controls the magnitude of the effect existing patient care delays have on the team's treatment decisions, where decisions to start patients in a service drop as actual return to clinic visit interval increases (relative to target RVI).  A value of "zero" implies that that no amount of care delay will influence the team's treatment decisions. A value of "1" implies that doubling the time between appointments for existing patients (e.g., delaying their care) will reduce the decisions to start in that service by half.  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would reduce the decisions to start in that service to 71% of the original rate, and a value of "1.5" would reduce the decisions to start to only 35% of the original rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| User Defined - Intake Evaluation Rate                               | The number of patients referred to intake evaluations with the team each week.  This replaces the base case value, which is estimated from team data on supply allocated to conducting intake evaluations.  (pts/wk)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| User-defined Percent Missed Appointments                            | The percent of appointments that must be re-scheduled, as either the clinician or the patient missed the appointment.  This replaces the base case value, which is estimated from team data. (appts/wk)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| User-defined Service Proportions from Supply                        | The percentage of patients who are recommended to start each service after completing either an intake evaluation or review. These replace the base case values, which are estimated from team data on the appointment supply, Return-to-clinic Visit Interval (RVI), missed appointment percentage, and median engagement (i.e., the available capacity to treat patients in a timely manner) in each service.  These percentages can sum to >1, as providers can decide to start a patient in multiple services.  (pct)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| User-defined Review Rate                                            | The number of patients whose care plan is reviewed and start a new service each week.  This replaces the base case value, which is estimated from team data on service start rates and CPT-coded intake evaluation completed visits.  (pts/wk)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| User-defined Service Proportions from Team Data                     | The percentage of patients who are recommended to start each service after completing either an intake evaluation or review. These replace the base case values, which are estimated directly from team data on new service start rates for each service in the team (i.e., haven't had this service in the team in the last six months).  These percentages can sum to >1, as providers can decided to start a patient in multiple services.
