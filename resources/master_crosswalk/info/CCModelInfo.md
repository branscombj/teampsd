Appointments are never   cancelled due to high wait times, but actual RVI is capped at 12 months (52   weeks) for ease of display.

If there is more demand than supply, then not all scheduled   appointments will be seen in a timely manner, and Actual RVI will   increase.

| CC    |  Effect of Task Time on   Missed Appointments                               | Effect of Task Time on Missed Appointments        |  When the team uses   overtime, they have less time available for important, but non-patient-facing   care tasks  (e.g., appointment prep,   charting, follow-up, reminder calls).    The more overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more   the missed appointment rate will increase, compared to the norm.  This effect only applies to overtime: working   lower than the official work hours does not influence providers or patients   to come more regularly to their appointments.

This effect only applies to above-target   wait times:  lower than expected new   patient wait times do not increase referrals above the norm.

| CC    |  Sensitivity of Missed   Appointments to Task Time                          | Sensitivity of Missed Appointments to Task Time   | This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in time for   non-patient-facing care tasks has on missed appointments.  A value of "zero" implies that   there is no relationship between overbooks and missed appointments. A value   below 1 indicates that patients are not sensitive to small changes in   non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that patients   are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20%   more hours per week than their official supply, then an exponent of   "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all   appointments would also be 20% higher than before. A value of "0.5"   would cause that same 20% increase in hours worked to have less of an effect   (causing only a 9.5% increase in the missed appointment percentage).  A value of "2" would cause that   same 20% increase to have a greater effect (raising the missed appointment   percentage by 44%).   |
| CC    |  Sensitivity of   Referrals to Wait Time                                    | Sensitivity of Referrals to Wait Time             | This controls the magnitude of the effect increases in new   patient wait time (or decreases in target wait time) have on referrals, where   referrals drop as wait time increases (or the target wait time   decreases).  A value of   "zero" implies that there is no relationship between wait time and   referrals.  A value of "1"   indicates that if  the new patient wait   time doubles (relative to the new patient wait time goal), then referring   providers will cut their care coordination referrals in half.  For the same situation, a value of   "0.5" would result in less of an effect (reducing the referral rate   to 71% of its original value), and a value of "1.5" would result in   a greater effect (reducing the referral rate to less than 35% of its original   value).                                                                                                                                                                              |
