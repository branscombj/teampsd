"Our Question: ","What happens if we increase appointment supply for EBPsy and group, decrease the number of appointments for Care Coordination , increase RVI for CC and PSY."
"Our Hypothesis: ","What happens if we increase appointment supply for EBPsy  to 8 appointments per week and we decrease the number of appointments for Care Coordination to 2 and CC  RVI out to 20 weeks and decrease PSY to 5 appts/wk and change RVI to 1, increase group to 5 appts/wk."
"Our Decisions: ","EBPsy or Group - we have to change the service proportions for those"
"Our Findings: ","We found that patients waiting for PSY increases temporarily but that improves over BC."
Waiting for intake was "untouched" so it stayed the same.
The patients currently engaged went to 10.
Work pressure - increases and then flattens out
Actual RVI - it increased for a couple of months, but then at about a year it decreases.
If we do a better job of matching the service to the need, it gets worse in the short-term but pays off in the long-run if the team. 
The chaos for EBPsy or Group is because we didn't refer more people to those services"
